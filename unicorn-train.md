# Unicorn Train 🦄 🦄 🦄

An alternative to Taco Bot

## The easiest way for teammates to recognise each other for doing great things

# How it works

- Include 🦄 emojis after tagging a colleague
- Each 🦄 counts as an entry in a draw (or on a leaderboard)
- Winners get **fabulous prizes** 😁

## Why we need it

- To help celebrate the awesome work by our team
- To boost morale, build a stronger team and create culture
- Because the alternatives are company-wide and this is fun _just for us_

## Why it's better than Taco Bot

- We can choose the users that take part, which caps the pricing
- It's cheaper ($2/user/mo or $19/user/yr)
- We can choose between prize draws or leaderboards
- 🦄 are better than 🌮

# Roadblocks

We need permission before we can add the Slack bot
