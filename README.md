# 🦄 Unicorn Train

> **📝 Note:** This is an archived project from 2021. The Unicorn Train Slack bot may no longer exist - I'm just preserving this presentation for posterity!

A fun little web presentation about implementing Unicorn Train - a Slack bot that lets team members celebrate each other's awesome work! 

## What's in here?

This repo contains a simple slide-style webpage that makes the case for adding Unicorn Train to your Slack workspace. It's basically a cooler, more focused alternative to Taco Bot.

The presentation explains how team members can use unicorn emojis (🦄) to recognize their colleagues' great work, with each unicorn counting as an entry for prizes or points on a leaderboard.

## Why Unicorn Train?

- It's team-specific (not company-wide)
- Super affordable at $2/user/month
- You can choose between prize draws or leaderboards
- And let's be honest... unicorns > tacos 🦄 > 🌮

## Getting Started

Just need permission to add the Slack bot and you're good to go! Hit up the team lead to make it happen.
